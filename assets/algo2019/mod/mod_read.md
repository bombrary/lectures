â€»  mod indicates modulo operation (represented '%' on C++.)

## 1. Custom on competitive programming

- In many problems about combination, we answer the number **modulo 1000000007**
- Thus we prepare MOD as constant value:
  ```cpp
  #define MOD 1000000007
  ```
- since C++11, we also use constexpr:
  ```cpp
  constexpr long long MOD = 1000000007;
  ```
- Node that **1000000007 is a prime number**
- Sometimes 1000000009 or 998244353 are used (prime numbrs!)

## 2. How is mod used as +, -, and \*

We have to take care of overfllow to use mod.

1. write usually
2. cover expression with ()=%
3. make function modXXX
   ex) modadd, modsub, modmul

---

### 2.1. Write usually

Note that a and b should be less than MOD.

```cpp
a = (a + b) % MOD;
a = (a * b) % MOD;
// write not (a - b) but (MOD + (a - b)) for fear (a - b) < 0
a = (MOD + (a - b)) % MOD; 
```

---

Another method

```cpp
a += b;
a %= MOD;

a += MOD - b;
a %= MOD;

a *= b;
a %= MOD;
```

---

### 2.2. Covering with ()%=MOD

```cpp
// apply modulo operation to a and b in advance
a %= MOD;
b %= MOD;

(a += b) %= MOD;
(a += MOD - b) %= MOD;
(a *= b) %= MOD;
```

---

### 2.3. make function modXXX

prepare as library:
```cpp
long long modadd(long long &a, long long b) {
  (a += b) %= MOD;
}

long long modsub(long long &a, long long b) {
  (a += MOD - b) %= MOD;
}

long long modmul(long long &a, long long b) {
  (a *= b) %= MOD;
}
```

---

how to use:
```cpp
modadd(a, b);
modsub(a, b);
modmul(a, b);
```

---

## 3. How is mod used as division

In sammary, we can use this fact:

If $p$ is a prime number, and $a$ and $b$ is less than p:
$$
\frac{a}{b} \equiv ab^{p-2}\ (mod\ p)
$$

- 1000000007 is a prime, so you can use that.
- $b^{p-2}$ can calculate fast with exponentation by squaring.

---

```cpp
long long moddiv(long long a, long long b) {
  return (a * modpow(b, MOD - 2)) % MOD;
}
```

---

## Addition

- Some people make the class **modint** to use modulo operation easily.
- modint class is made using operator overloading.
- If you want to know this, please ask google.

Example:
```cpp
class modint {
  ...
}

modint a, b;
modint n1, n2, n3, n4;
n1 = a + b;
n2 = a - b;
n3 = a * b;
n4 = a / b;
n5 = pow(a, b);
```

# Appendix

## Proof of a/b = a\*b^(p - 2)

Bellow is a proof of this fact.
  - You don't have to understand the proof if you only use it.

---

### Outline of proof

1. Definition of congruence relation: $a \equiv b$
2. Definition of $\displaystyle\frac{a}{b}$
3. Proof of $a \equiv b \Rightarrow ka \equiv kb$
4. Inverse element: $b^{-1}$: $\displaystyle\frac{a}{b}\equiv ab^{-1}$
5. Fermat's little theorem $b^{-1} \equiv b^{p-2}\ (mod\ p)\ \text{if } p \text{ is a prime number}$

---

### 1. Definition of congruence relation

$$
a \equiv b (mod\ m)\ \Leftrightarrow\ \exists k \in \mathbb{Z}\ s.t.\ a - b = mk
$$

---

### 2. Definition of divition

When thinking of modulo $m$,
$\displaystyle \frac{a}{b}$ is defined as $x$ such that $bx \equiv a\ (mod\ m)$

---

#### Example

About $\displaystyle\frac{4}{3}$ in modulo 7: $x$ such that $3x \equiv 4 (mod\ 7)$

<div style="padding-left: 1em;">

When $x \equiv 6$:

  <div style="padding-left: 1em;">

$3x \equiv 3\cdot 6 \equiv 18 \equiv 4 (mod\ 7)$

  </div>

thus $\displaystyle\frac{4}{3} \equiv 6 (mod\ 7)$

</div>

---

### 3. Proof of characteristics of modulo arthmetics
$$
a \equiv b \Rightarrow \forall k \in \mathbb{Z},\ ka \equiv kb\ (mod\ m)
$$

Proof: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
a \equiv b\ (mod\ m) &\Rightarrow a - b = m\cdot l\ (l \in \mathbb{Z})\\
  &\Rightarrow ka - kb = m\cdot kl\\
  &\Rightarrow ka \equiv kb
\end{aligned}
$$

---

### 4. Inverse element

- Inverse element of $b$ is defined as $x$ such that $bx \equiv 1\ (mod\ m)$.
- It is represented as $b^{-1}$ or $\displaystyle\frac{1}{b}$.

---

If we know $b^{-1}$, we can easily answer $\displaystyle\frac{a}{b}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
bx \equiv a &\Rightarrow b^{-1}bx \equiv b^{-1}a\\
  &\Rightarrow 1\cdot x \equiv b^{-1}a \\
  &\Rightarrow x \equiv ab^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

thus $\displaystyle\frac{a}{b} = ab^{-1}$.

- Inverse element in modular arthmetics does not always exist.

---

### 5. Fermat's little theorem: 

If $a$ is integer, $p$ is a prime number, and $gcd(a, p) = 1$:
$$
a^{p-1} \equiv 1 (mod\ p)
$$

- There are various proofs of this theorem (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem">this margin is too narrow to contain!</a>)

---

If $p$ is a prime number, you can know $b^{-1}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  &\ b^{p-1} \equiv 1 (mod\ p)\ ;\ \text{Fermat's Little Theorem}\\
  \Rightarrow&\ b\underline{b^{p-2}} \equiv 1\ (mod\ p)
\end{aligned}
$$

$b^{-1}$ is $x$ such that $b\underline{x} \equiv 1\ (mod\ p)$.
$\Rightarrow\ b^{-1} \equiv b^{p-2}\ (mod\ p)$

---

In sammary, 
$$
\frac{a}{b} \equiv ab^{-1} \equiv ab^{p-2}
$$
